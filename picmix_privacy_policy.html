<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We provide you with the rights described below when you use our Services. Please contact us at <a href="http://photocollage.help@gmail.com/"><span class="s2">picmix.help@gmail.com</span></a> if you would like to exercise your rights under applicable law. When we receive an individual rights request from you, please make sure you are ready to verify your identity. Please be advised that there are limitations to your individual rights. We may limit your individual rights in the following ways:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Where denial of access is required or authorized by law;</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">When granting access would have a negative impact on other's privacy;</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">To protect our rights and properties; and</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Where the request is frivolous or burdensome.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Right to withdraw consent. If we rely on consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. A withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of our processing or the processing of any third parties based on consent before your withdrawal.<br>
Right of access and rectification. If you request a copy of your personal information that we hold, we will provide you with a copy without undue delay and free of charge, except where we are permitted by law to charge a fee. We may limit your access if such access would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other individuals. You may also request to correct or update any of your personal information held by us, unless you can already do so directly via the Services.<br>
Right to erasure (the "Right to be Forgotten"). You may request us to erase any of your personal information held by us that: is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed; was collected in relation to processing that you previously consented to, but later withdrew such consent; or was collected in relation to processing activities to which you object, and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for our processing.<br>
Right to restriction. You have the right to restrict our processing your personal information where one of the following applies:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">You contest the accuracy of your personal information that we processed. We will restrict the processing of your personal information, which may result in an interruption of some or all of the Services, during the period necessary for us to verify the accuracy of your personal information;</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">The processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information and request the restriction of its use instead;</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">We no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but it is required by you to establish, exercise or defense of legal claims; or</span></li>
  <li class="li5"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">You have objected to processing, pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of our processing override your rights.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We will only process your restricted personal information shall with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest. We will inform you if or when the restriction is lifted.<br>
Right to object to processing. You may object to our processing at any time and as permitted by applicable law if we process your personal information on the legal basis of consent, contract or legitimate interests. We can continue to process your personal information if it is necessary for the defense of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable law.<br>
Right to data portability. If we process your personal information based on a contract with you or based on your consent, or the processing is carried out by automated means, you may request to receive your personal information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to have us transfer your personal information directly to another "controller", where technically feasible, unless exercise of this right adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others.<br>
Notification to third-parties. If we share your personal information with third parties, we will notify them of any requests for rectification, erasure or restriction of your personal information, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Upon your request, we will identify such third parties.<br>
Automated individual decision-making, including profiling. You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing of your personal information, including profiling, which produces legal or similarly significant effects on you, unless an exception applies under applicable law.<br>
Right to Lodge a Complaint. If you believe we have infringed or violated your privacy rights, please contact us at <a href="http://photocollage.help@gmail.com/"><span class="s2">picmix.help@gmail.com</span></a> so that we can work to resolve your concerns. You also have a right to lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory authority situated in a Member State of your habitual residence, place of work, or place of alleged infringement.<br>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you choose to use the Services or provide your information to us, your personal information may be transferred to, processed and maintained on servers or databases located outside of the country or jurisdiction where you are located. Such countries or jurisdictions may have data protection laws that are less protective than the laws of the jurisdiction in which you reside. If you do not want your information transferred to or processed or maintained outside of the country or jurisdiction where you are located, you should not use the Services.<br>
Designated Countries: We transfer your personal information subject to appropriate safeguards as permitted under the Data Protection Laws. Specifically, when your personal information is transferred out of the Designated Countries, we have the required contractual provisions for transferring personal information in place with the third-parties to which your information is transferred. For such transfers, we rely on legal transfer mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses or we work with U.S. based third parties that are certified under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.</span></p>
